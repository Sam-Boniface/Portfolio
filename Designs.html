				<h2> Outbreak </h2>
				<h3> Witness recount of day one of the outbreak </h3>
				<blockquote>
				It was just a day like any other. I got up, got dressed and went to work. It was Tuesday... at lunch... that's when it happened. <br>
				It was like the man was crazed, he started attacking this woman, pinned her to the ground. <br>
				People rushed over to help, they dragged him off her, but that only made things worse, the man started attacking others. <br>
				Eventually he was restrained but apparently he had bitten several of the people trying to restrain him. <br>
				He must have infected them or something... they all fell to the ground fitting. <br>
				When it they finally stopped fitting, they all seemed dead, until they got to their feet. <br>
				That's when the outbreak really took hold.
